1. Database File Storage

    The contacts are stored in a file, likely a binary or text file, acting as a simple database. This file will be used to persist the contact information even after the program is closed.
    Each contact entry may include details such as:
        Name: The full name of the contact.
        Phone Number: A valid phone number format.
        Email: A valid email address.
        Address: Physical address, if applicable.
    The file is used to load contacts when the program starts and save new or edited contacts when changes are made.

2. Basic Functionalities

The system will likely include the following core features:

    Add Contact: A function to create a new contact and append it to the file.
    Delete Contact: A function to search for a specific contact (using a unique identifier like a name or phone number) and remove it from the file.
    Search Contacts: A function to find contacts by searching for specific fields like name, phone number, or email.
    Update Contact: A function to modify the details of an existing contact.
    View All Contacts: A feature that lists all the contacts stored in the file.

3. Searching Mechanism

    The search functionality would typically involve reading the entire list of contacts from the file into memory (perhaps into an array or linked list) and then running the search operation based on the input criteria (name, phone, etc.).
    You may implement efficient search algorithms depending on how large you expect the contact list to grow.

4. File Handling

    The system reads from and writes to a file in a structured format. You might use:
        Text Files: Where each contact is stored in a line-based format (e.g., CSV).
        Binary Files: A more efficient storage format that minimizes space and I/O operations.
    Proper handling of file opening, closing, and error checking is crucial to ensure data integrity.

5. User Interface

    The system likely interacts with the user via a console-based interface. The user would be able to input commands to add, delete, search, or view contacts.
    Error handling and prompts should be included to guide users through invalid inputs (e.g., missing fields or incorrectly formatted phone numbers).

6. Data Structures

    Arrays or linked lists may be used to temporarily store the contacts loaded from the file. This allows easy manipulation before writing back to the file.

7. Possible Enhancements

    Sorting: Add the ability to sort contacts by name, phone number, or other fields.
    Encryption: Implement basic encryption for sensitive data like phone numbers or addresses.
    Backup & Restore: Introduce a backup system to save a copy of the database file and restore it if necessary.
